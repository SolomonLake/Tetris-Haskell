README - Tetris

Simple Tetris game

Will represent the current piece as a list of game.points, will also represent the top line of pieces this way.
When a current piece collides with the bottom, it will enter a list of pieces that make up the dropped pieces and will
stop being current piece.
Could maybe use grid for placed pieces.

tile = one segement of a piece


stuff to do on piece land:
update botLS with new bottom structure
instantiate new piece, make this piece current
	-random element :)
add old piece to list of placed pieces


also need to make rotation and translation check for bumping into previously placed pieces, using pieces list



initialization:
ghc Tetris.hs -main-is Tetris
./Tetris
