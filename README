README - Tetris

Simple Tetris game

Will represent the current piece as a list of game.points, will also represent the top line of pieces this way.
When a current piece collides with the bottom, it will enter a list of pieces that make up the dropped pieces and will
stop being current piece.
Could maybe use grid for placed pieces.

tile = one segement of a piece

example initialization:
ghc Pong.hs -main-is Pong
./Pong
